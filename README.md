## Introduction

Repository for all student facing material as part of the Digital and Social Media Strategies Course taught at Tilburg University in 2024/25.

The syllabus for the course is available [here](https://github.com/deer-marketing-lab/2024-dsms/blob/main/syllabus/2024_dsms_syllabus.pdf)

In the 7 week Block course we cover the following material in lectures:

* Lecture 1: Course Introduction
* Lecture 2: Advertising Attribution Models
* Lecture 3: Media Mix Modelling
* Lecture 4: Field Experiments
* Lecture 5: Field Experiments in Digital Advertising
* Lecture 6: User Generated Content and Reviews
* Lecture 7: Word of Mouth and Influencers
* Lecture 8: Firm Generated Content and Viral Marketing

Note that each lecture as a set of source files is availble in the 'lectures/' subdirectory. Slides are built with `xaringan`, workspace dependences are managed via `env`, and I use `Snakemake` to build slides and manage (most) dependencies.

There are accompanying tutorial assignments ('labs') for Lectures 2 through 7 in the `labs/` subdirectory.

Instructors who are interested in example exams, and solutions to the labs should contact me [via email](mailto:lachlan.deer@gmail.com?subject=Undergraduate%20Digital%20Marketing%20Teaching%20Material)
